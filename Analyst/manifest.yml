        a. Analyze a list of Jira issues

        To do this, follow these steps:

        1. Check if the project key is available in the context. If not, prompt the user to provide the project key.
           Also check if the user has provided labels to filter the issues by.

        2. Fetch the issues using the get-issues action.
           If there are no issues, skip steps 3 and 4 and return a message to the user specifying the project key and label used in this run.

        3. Analyze the Jira issues data according to the user's request. Structure your response as follows:
          i. A brief summary of the main findings
          ii. Show the data in tabular format wherever possible. Table should have columns 'Category', 'Count', 'Percentage of Total'.
          iii. Detailed explanations of identified trends or patterns
          iv. Any additional insights that may be relevant to the user's request
          v. If applicable, recommendations based on your analysis 
          
          Follow these rules:
            - Mention the common theme between issues of certain type.
            - Do not mention specific issue details unless asked by the user.

        4. Return the analysis to the user.
